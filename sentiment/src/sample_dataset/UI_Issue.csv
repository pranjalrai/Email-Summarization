"Hi Gopu We are discussing the UI issue internally to look into this further. Regarding the file service errors below, those are unrelated to UI issue that you previously mentioned. Can you share the logs for these errors?","Feb 17, 2020 at 4:40 PM",FALSE
"Hi Gopu, Also, to follow up on this bit: Also Please give more details about Fixed issue where having SITE_SETTING_ONLY_SITE_ADMIN_CAN_EDIT_ORG set could, under specific circumstances, cause users to not be able to view organizations they were a member of. That bug is only exploitable under very specific circumstance and is highly unlikely to happen, especially when using SAML or LDAP.

"Hello Gopu, We believe there may be an issue with the redis cache being corrupted. You can reset that cache by deleting the redis pod and letting it be recreated. If that does fix the issue, please let us know. If it does not fix the issue, the next step would be to retrieve the logs from the account-service, webapp and api-server pods and send them to us for review.","Feb 19, 2020 at 11:32 PM",FALSE

Yep I think we're good,"Feb 25, 2020 at 5:36 AM",FALSE

I just bumped the ticket today to ask them - they went radio silent after my request for them to delete redis and/or send us logs last Wednesday.,"Feb 25, 2020 at 5:44 AM",FALSE
"Hi David, After deleting the pods looks fine ..., but this same issue raised after few days","Feb 25, 2020 at 9:43 AM",TRUE
SC team reached me today and mentioned this issue is happening more frequently nowadays (twice a day) and they have to clear the cache to resolve it. They are not happy in clearing the cache. Can you please help to suggest a permanent solution?,"Feb 27, 2020 at 4:07 PM",FALSE
"I was talking to Sudeep, and he mentioned that he was going to get a video of this happening for us to look at. Not sure if he managed to do that. After the issue happens, does it go away when they refresh the screen again? Does it happen on just one random page load? If so, clearing the redis cache isn't actually the fix/problem. If it were cache corruption, I think it would stay wrong. I've tried to reproduce this on instabase.com (refreshing for many many minutes) and I can't get it to reproduce. I don't have any ideas, but I can try to take a look when I get into the office today and get my hands on an SC laptop.","Feb 27, 2020 at 11:32 PM",FALSE
"As we do not have SC laptops in Blr, I tried this out with a couple of SC people at our office and could not get this to replicate. Gopu has also been in workshops and I believe should be available tomorrow, so we can replicate and record it if this replicates. From last time when we tried this over zoom - - does it go away after refreshing screen - yes - does it happen on just one random page load - yes","Feb 28, 2020 at 12:18 AM",FALSE
"I did not have a chance to try this out on their laptop today. As a next step forward so that we can make progress (and not be blocked on someone going into the SF office), in addition to the video, it would be great if we could also get the logs for the services we mentioned before: account-service, webapp and api-server.","Feb 28, 2020 at 9:50 AM",FALSE
"Thanks, heymian. Can you ask or help Gopu for those logs when you touch base with him Sudeep? He never replied to David’s requests for them last week and earlier this week.","Feb 28, 2020 at 9:54 AM",FALSE
"Sudeep, another idea for debugging if you (or whoever) gets to look at their cluster. Can you confirm that all their services are properly pushed, especially the three that I asked for logs on. Maybe we have one rogue/outdated pod lying around and any request that's getting routed to that one is causing problems.","Feb 28, 2020 at 9:58 AM",FALSE
"Gopu and I caught up, and he is not able to reproduce this issue atm, and he believes that its because of purging the cache daily. I will ask him to stop doing this temporarily to allow reproducing the problem. David, you can use remote control over zoom on SC laptop to replicate this (we do the same here for the lack of laptop around). In case you are able to replicate this can you also loop in Heymian on identifying root cause as she has the most context on the related services. The credentials for accessing logs on openshift are on 1 pass. Heymian, hopefully this works for you all. I do not think this problem will replicate in our prod infra structure as it does not look deterministic and seems to occur only at SC.","Feb 28, 2020 at 4:06 PM",FALSE
